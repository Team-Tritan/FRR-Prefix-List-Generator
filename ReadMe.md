# FRR Prefix List Generator

Made with love by [AS393577](https://tritan.gg) <3

## Overview

This project will generate BGP prefix lists, it pulls ASN from the output on the FRR bgp summary command then fetches their AS-SETs. Following this, it builds filters based on as-sets and adds them to the running config.

It essentially does the following:

- Gets all bgp neighbors dynamically
- Polls peeringdb api for as-set listed
  - If an ASN is on an ignore list (like IXP asns, transit, etc-- things that don't need specific or automated filters) it will ignore it.
  - If there is no as-set listed in peeringdb, it defaults to the ASN while generating filters.
- Generates prefix lists from the as-set/asn via bgpq4, and pipes them into FRR's running config.
  - The naming format for prefix lists are as follow: `AS00000-In-v4` or `AS00000-In-v6`. Your route maps for the neighbors will need to reflect this.

You can run this on a cronjob, daily, weekly, whatever. It saves it into the running config so you can default back to your orignal frr config by reloading it at any time.

## Dependencies

You'll need to install the following deps on the linux box:
- `bgpq4`
- `bun runtime`
    - (or compile to js conventionally and use node)
 
Install the deps within the codebase:
- `bun install`

## Starting The Script 

There are different ways you can run this, and I'll give a base level introduction to a few of them.

### Dev:

- With Bun installed, run `bun install` to get packages.
- Run `bun dev` to start the script.

### Compiling to Binary:
You can also just use bun to compile to a binary, we've included a binary in the repo named `Generate`. This is built for our use case, and you'll need to recompile the binary using bun when you make changes.

- `bun build ./src/main.ts --compile --outfile {binary name}`
- Setup a cronjob to run the binary, or setup a system service, etc. Run the binary however you want lol. 

### Bun Runtime on Cronjob:

- Run `which bun` to get the executable of bun.
- Create a cronjob as root: `crontab -u root -E`
- Start using bun in the crontab, this example is every day at 00:00:
  - `0 0 * * * /root/.nvm/versions/node/v20.14.0/bin/bun run /root/folder/src/main.ts`

Alternatively, compile the ts to js and use node as the runtime.
